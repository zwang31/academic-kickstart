# Abstract.
abstract = "Various methods have been developed to investigate the geospatial information, temporal
component, and message content in disaster-related social media data to enrich human-centric
information for situational awareness. However, few studies have simultaneously analyzed these
three dimensions (i.e. space, time, and content). With an attempt to bring a space–time perspective into situational awareness, this study develops a novel approach to integrate space, time, and
content dimensions in social media data and enable a space–time analysis of detailed social
responses to a natural disaster. Using Markov transition probability matrix and location quotient,
we analyzed the Hurricane Sandy tweets in New York City and explored how people’s conversational topics changed across space and over time. Our approach offers potential to facilitate
efficient policy/decision-making and rapid response in mitigations of damages caused by natural
disasters."
