# Abstract.
abstract = "Social media data are increasingly being used for enhancing situationalawareness and assisting disaster management. We analyzed the wildfire-related Twitteractivities in terms of their attributes pertinent to space, time, content, and network, so as togain insights into the usefulness of social media data in revealing situational awareness.Findings show that social media data can characterize the wildfire across space and overtime, and thus are applicable to provide useful information on disaster situations. Second,people have strong geographical awareness during wildfire hazards and are interested incommunicating situational updates related to wildfire damage (e.g., containment percent-age and burned acres), wildfire response (e.g., evacuation), and appreciation to firefighters.Third, news media and local authorities are opinion leaders and play a dominant role in thewildfire retweet network"
